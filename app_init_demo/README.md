The android portion of this is able to communicate with a remote server using URL encoded JSON over HTTP. It is not communicating with the primary go server at this time because the go server uses raw JSON over HTTP instead of URL-encoded JSON. This is an issue that we encountered at the last min and will fix soon. In the mean time we have proved that we were able to get our android app to communicate with an external server.
